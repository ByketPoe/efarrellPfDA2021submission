    "##### The NumPy.Random package is a sub-package of the NumPy library, a library in the Python programming language. The NumPy library provides functions and data structures that are useful for numerical processing for data analytics purposes. A common need in data analytics is generating random samples of data. The NumPy.Random package exists for this purpose. \n",

    "##### In this notebook, the primary uses of the NumPy.Random package are explained. Some functions in the package will be explained in detail, as will some distributions that the package can generate. The generation of random numbers using seeds will also be explained. "

    "##### The purpose of seed is to provide a starting point for random number generation. It is difficult to truely randomly generate lists of numbers, so seeds are generated to begin the process. They are generated at the point in which the package is imported, and are typically based on the time of the machine. If one were to understand how the seed is generated, it would be possible to guess the list of numbers that are produced. "
